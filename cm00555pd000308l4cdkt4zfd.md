### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the longest palindromic substring in `s`. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

```plaintext
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

### Approach

The problem requires finding the longest palindromic substring within the given string `s`. To solve this problem, we use a technique that expands around the center of potential palindromes.

#### Expanding Around Center Explanation:

1. **Center of the Palindrome:**
    
    * The idea is to consider each character (and the gap between each pair of characters) in the string as a potential center of a palindrome.
        
    * For each center, expand outwards as long as the characters on both sides are equal.
        
2. **Two Cases for the Center:**
    
    * **Odd-Length Palindromes:** Consider each character as the center.
        
    * **Even-Length Palindromes:** Consider each gap between two consecutive characters as the center.
        
3. **Helper Function:**
    
    * The helper function `helper` expands outwards from a given center and returns the longest palindrome found.
        
    * We then compare this palindrome with the previously found longest palindrome and update accordingly.
        

### Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            return null;
        }

        if (s.length() == 1) {
            return s;
        }

        String longest = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            String tmp = helper(s, i, i);

            if (tmp.length() > longest.length()) {
                longest = tmp;
            }

            tmp = helper(s, i, i + 1);

            if (tmp.length() > longest.length()) {
                longest = tmp;
            }
        }
        
        return longest;
    }

    public String helper(String s, int left, int right) {

        while (left >= 0 && right <= s.length() - 1 && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }

        return s.substring(left + 1, right);
    }
}
```

### Analysis

* **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(n2), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because for each character in the string, we potentially expand outwards to the entire length of the string.
    
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) excluding the space required to store the output string, as we are only using a few extra variables.
    

### Conclusion

This approach efficiently finds the longest palindromic substring by expanding around each possible center in the string. The helper function ensures that we consider both odd and even length palindromes, allowing us to correctly identify the longest palindrome in all cases.
