## Why did I decide to write and create Blogy?

## Welcome everyoneüëãthis is my first blog post!

***More about me!***

My name is Mohammed Salah I have been working as a Back-end developer for over 3 years now. I'm 25, living in Assiut-Egypt, Swimmer, Tech passionate, Coffee addict, and Bugs lover.

Recently I've started to share my knowledge and my life with others. So, I started to pursuit that by making this blog. Also, I'm getting involved with the tech community overseas by contributing to the community on social media like  [Twitter ](https://twitter.com/Sala7JR) and  [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salah96/) .  

## When I was a student I've been through a lot üëá

‚óè ***My journey from Graphic design to Web development.***

This is the field where everything started, I got my first Photoshop course and I loved to be a graphic designer, I like the creative way of thinking when trying to do a new illustration or design  [Behance](https://www.behance.net/Mr_Salah22) .

Everything works better when you play with colours and layers that makes me motivated and passionate about Web design and learning more about HTML, CSS and JS. I made my first unresponsive web page and I was so satisfied with it.

Then, I moved on to learn more about "web design and development" by learning some server-side languages like PHP, Python and I've been enamoured by the Back-end stuff. From there my journey begins towards back-end development. 

‚óè ***Community commitment.***

Since Transferring knowledge was my passion, I was committed to being an active part of the campus by working as a media chair at  [ACM](https://www.acm.org/chapters/students)  Assiut student chapter and  [MSP ](https://mspegypt.wordpress.com/tech-clubs/) tech club-Assiut University.

‚óè ***Teaching.***

I also worked as a front-end instructor at AKWAN ( Kids centre specializes in teaching kids about programming, AI and more like that ).

‚óè ***Freelance.***

I worked with Assiut Oil Refining Company  [ASORC](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%B7_%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%84) , made some Urgent fixes to their website, And got my first thankful mail. That's made me so happy and surprised as 3rd year CS student. I wanted to do more in different ways and add some special touches to every project I will work on.

‚óè ***The graduation.***

My graduation project was a car parking mobile app called "Gaps" written with python and Django framework. The app is depending on machine learning and street camera shots. 

I was responsible for managing the interchange of data between the server and the users. My primary focus was the development of all server-side logic, definition and maintenance of the central database, and ensuring high performance and responsiveness to requests from the front-end.

Finally, I got my computer science BSc degree from Assiut University and I've started working as a freelancer back-end developer in 2018.

## Getting my  [ITI](https://www.iti.gov.eg/) open-source certificate in 2019.

I got my ITI certificate and I graduated at the top of my class in addition to my college degree. I was the team leader and worked with my team on a Blood donation app called "Be positive" OR "B+"  [Github](https://github.com/salah21500/Be-Positive#readme).

## My military service.

I served in the Egyptian armed forces as an air defence officer, this period added to me a lot of knowledge and character development. Also, I developed myself in my career and read many books related to computer science. There I wrote this article, developed my Portfolio and my Blog.

## What I'm going to be writing about?

I code by day, but I like to be a writer by night. I admire exploring new technologies and discovering new issues because that makes me challenge new things and willing to do whatever it takes to solve them.

So, I'll write about the new challenges I face, new technologies I learn, also my life and I'll share my experience with others to help them to increase their knowledge and open discussions for all parts' benefits.
