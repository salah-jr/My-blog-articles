**Problem Statement:**

Given a table `Employee` containing the columns `id`, `name`, and `managerId`, find the names of employees who are managers with at least five direct reports.

**Example:**

```sql
Employee
+----+-------+-----------+
| id | name  | managerId |
+----+-------+-----------+
| 1  | John  | NULL      |
| 2  | Mike  | 1         |
| 3  | Anna  | 1         |
| 4  | Joe   | 2         |
| 5  | Jane  | 2         |
| 6  | Alex  | 1         |
| 7  | Mary  | 2         |
| 8  | Alice | 1         |
| 9  | Bob   | 1         |
+----+-------+-----------+

Output:
+-------+
| name  |
+-------+
| John  |
+-------+
```

In this example, John is the only manager with at least five direct reports.

**Approach:**

To identify managers with at least five direct reports, we:

1. Join the `Employee` table with itself to pair managers (`e1`) with their direct reports (`e2`).
    
2. Group the results by the manager's ID.
    
3. Use the `HAVING` clause to filter groups with five or more direct reports.
    

**Solution:**

```sql
SELECT
    e1.name 
FROM 
    Employee e1
JOIN 
    Employee e2 
ON 
    e1.id = e2.managerId
GROUP BY 
    e1.id 
HAVING 
    COUNT(e1.id) >= 5;
```

**Explanation:**

* **Join Condition:** The table is joined with itself based on the manager's ID ([`e1.id`](http://e1.id)) and the employee's `managerId` (`e2.managerId`).
    
* **Grouping:** The results are grouped by the manager's ID to aggregate the direct reports.
    
* **Filtering:** The `HAVING` clause filters out groups where the count of direct reports is less than five.
    

**Analysis:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) due to the self-join operation, where n is the number of rows in the table.
    
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) as the join operation and subsequent grouping use additional space proportional to the number of rows.
    

**Optimization:**

This solution is optimal for the given problem constraints. The self-join ensures accurate pairing of managers with their direct reports, and the use of aggregate functions efficiently filters the desired result.

**Conclusion:**

This SQL query identifies managers with at least five direct reports by leveraging self-joins and aggregate functions. The solution is both efficient and easy to understand, providing accurate results for the given problem.
