**Problem Statement:**

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. For example, `121` is a palindrome, but `123` is not.

**Example:**

```java
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads the same backward as forward.
```

**Approach:**

To determine if a number is a palindrome, we use a two-pointer approach by reversing the second half of the number and comparing it to the first half. First, handle edge cases where the number is less than 0 or ends with a 0. Then, reverse the digits of the number while comparing the reversed portion with the remaining digits.

**Solution:**

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x == 0)
            return true;

        if (x < 0 || (x % 10) == 0)
            return false;

        int reverse = 0;
        int num = x;

        while (num > reverse) {
            reverse = num % 10 + reverse * 10;
            num = (int)(num / 10);
        }

        return (num == reverse || num == (int)(reverse / 10));
    }
}
```

Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of the solution:

1. **Initial Checks:**
    
    * If the number is `0`, it is a palindrome by definition.
        
    * If the number is negative or ends in `0` (but is not `0`), it cannot be a palindrome because negative numbers and numbers ending in `0` (except `0` itself) do not read the same backward.
        
2. **Reverse the Second Half of the Number:**
    
    * Initialize `reverse` to store the reversed portion of the number.
        
    * Iterate through the number, extracting the last digit and building the reversed number.
        
3. **Comparison:**
    
    * The loop continues until the original number is less than or equal to the reversed number. By this point, `reverse` contains the reversed second half of the number.
        
    * To determine if the number is a palindrome:
        
        * `num == reverse`: This check ensures that the first half of the number matches the reversed second half if the number has an even number of digits.
            
        * `num == (int)(reverse / 10)`: This check handles the case where the number has an odd number of digits. Dividing `reverse` by 10 effectively removes the middle digit of the reversed number, allowing us to compare the remaining digits with the first half of the original number.
            

**Analysis:**

* **Time Complexity:** O(log(n)), where n is the input number. This is because we are iterating through the digits of the number.
    
* **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
    

**Optimization:**

This solution is optimized for both time and space. The approach ensures that the number is only partially reversed and compared, which avoids the overhead of converting the number to a string or using additional space.

**Conclusion:**

This solution effectively determines if a number is a palindrome by reversing part of the number and comparing it with the remaining part. This approach is efficient and straightforward.
