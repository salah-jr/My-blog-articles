Hello again with a new lightweight article that will touch on in-depth the step-by-step implementation of a real-time contact form using the Laravel Livewire framework.

#### What is Livewire? 

Livewire is a full-stack framework that will make your life easier in the process of building dynamic interfaces in Laravel. It allows you to focus on building awesome applications instead of getting stuck with how to implement the features or writing a complex bunch of JavaScript code.

***Enough talking let's build some magic... üòã***

### Installation and basic setup.

> *I will assume that you have a fresh brand new Laravel project.*

First, we need to install Livewire in our project by running the following command in the terminal.

` composer require livewire/livewire `

Once Livewire is installed successfully, You must include the Livewire javascript and styles files on every page that will be using Livewire in my case I will include them in my layout file and extend it anywhere I want to use Livewire.

This will happen by adding `@livewireStyles`  inside the head tag and `@livewireScripts` right before the closing body tag.

*So, the `views/layouts/app.blade.php` file will be like:-*
```
    @livewireStyles
</head>
<body>
    @yield('content')

    @livewireScripts
</body>
```
*And I will create a `home.blade.php` file to extend the app layout inside it.*
```
@extends('layouts.app')
@section('content')
    
@endsection

```
*Let's update our `web.php` route file to load our home view file.*

```
Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('home');
});

```

Now run `php artisan make:model Message -m` to create the Message model and migration.
Then add the following columns to the message's migration file.

```
$table->string("name");
$table->string("email");
$table->text("message");
``` 
And in the `Message.php` model add the fillable property.

`protected $fillable = ['name', 'email', 'message'];`

*Don't forget to configure your DB variables in `.env` file and run the migrations*

***Congrats ü•≥, now you are ready to create your first Livewire component.***

### Creating a Livewire component.

 let's create our contact form component by running this command in your terminal.

`php artisan make:livewire contact-form`

> 
*Of course, you're free to choose the component name.*

This is supposed to be the message after executing the previous command or a similar one.
![Untitled-1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1640726192617/G9Z8_uz3c.png)

As we see there are two Livewire directories created with a file inside each one of them.
1. The blade file inside the views/livewire directory `contact-form.blade.php`.
2. The component class inside the Http/Livewire directory `ContactForm.php`.

**Before, going deeper, let's take a close look at the `render` method in the `ContactForm.php` class.**
```
use Livewire\Component;

class ContactForm extends Component
{
    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.contact-form');
    }
}
```
Whenever the initial page is loaded or the component is updated the `render` method will be called automatically and render the component view file with the new updates.

Let's include our component view file in the `home.blade.php` file using `@livewire` blade directive.
```
@extends('layouts.app')

@section('content')
    
@livewire('contact-form')

@endsection
```



**It's the time for building our form now üòä.**

 Go to `contact-form.blade.php` and add these HTML form lines *(Just for simplicity I will style it later, check the project [repo](https://github.com/salah-jr/Livewire-article-demo) on my Github)*

```
    <form>
        @csrf
        <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">

        <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email">

        <textarea placeholder="Write your message"></textarea>

        <button type="submit"> Send Message </button>
    </form>

```

> 
IMPORTANT NOTE: A single root element is a MUST for any Livewire component to work fine.

Livewire automatically provides the public data in the component PHP class for the component blade file without needing to pass it manually to the view also keeps track of any changes that happen in these public properties and automatically render them to the front-end.

So, We will add our contact form fields as public properties inside the `ContactForm.php` class.

***Shall we do some code to make it clear?***

```
class ContactForm extends Component
{
    public $name;
    public $email;
    public $message;

     ...
}
```
Now, These properties are accessible in the `contact-form.blade.php` file. 

For example, If you have `public $test = "Hello World!"` in the component class and you type `` {{ $test }} `` in your blade then you will see in the browser "Hello World!". If any change happens to the `$test` property Livewire will automatically make an AJAX request to the server with the changes and the server will re-render the component and respond with the new HTML. 

Now we want to bind the data (name, email, message) from our front-end component blade file to our public properties in the component class so, thus any changes that happen in certain HTML element values will be synchronized automatically with the particularly public properties in the component class. That happens by adding `wire:model= " property name "` in the input HTML element.

 *Let's do that, In `contact-form.blade.php` file... *

```
<form>
    @csrf
    <input wire:model="name" type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">

    <input wire:model="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter your email">

    <textarea wire:model="message" placeholder="Write your message"></textarea>

    <button type="submit">Send message</button>
</form>

```
Any data will be typed in the input field, Livewire will listen to that particular input event and send an AJAX request with the new data to re-render the component with it.

By binding our data to the component class through `wire:model` now we need to save that data in our database or do whatever else we need So, we need to submit our form to perform the saving process.

`<form wire:submit.prevent="saveMessage">`

***what does this line do? ü§î***

Simply, It prevents the default form submission and when the form is submitted the `saveMessage` method in the component class will be executed immediately.

We need to implement that method with some form validation and another one to reset our form fields from the data to make it ready for the next message.

 *In 'ContactForm.php' class.*

```
protected $rules = [
    'name' => 'required|min:4',
    'email' => 'required|email',
    'message' => 'required|min:16',
];

public function saveMessage(){

    $this->validate();

    Message::create([
        'name' => $this->name,
        'email' => $this->email,
        'message' => $this->message,
    ]);

    $this->resetFormFields();
}

public function resetFormFields()
{
    $this->reset(['name', 'email', 'message']);
}

```

**Let's explain what happens hereüëÜ.**

Livewire is shipped with the `$rules` property by default to set the validation rules for each property's data and the `$this->validate()` method to use these rules to validate the values inside our component public properties.

After that, we created the message and save it to the database, then we reset the values using our `resetFormFields` method which uses Livewire built-in `reset` method to clear our public properties values and therefore, the form fields will be empty and ready for the next message.


 **The final thing, We're almost done ü§©.**

We need to notify the user of the error messages if the validation failed. The standard Laravel `@errors` object will be available inside our view file if any `ValidationException` thrown.

Now, let us see the whole code to make everything clear.

*The `contact-form.blade.php` file*
```
<form wire:submit.prevent="saveMessage">
    @csrf
    <input wire:model="name" type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
    @error('name') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    <input wire:model="email" type="email" placeholder="Enter your email">
    @error('email') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    <textarea wire:model="message" placeholder="Write your message"></textarea>
    @error('message') <span class="error">{{ $message }}</span> @enderror

    <button type="submit">Send message</button>
</form>

```

*The `ContactForm.php` file*

```
<?php

namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;
use App\Models\Message;

class ContactForm extends Component
{

    public $name;
    public $email;
    public $message;

    protected $rules = [
        'name' => 'required|min:4',
        'email' => 'required|email',
        'message' => 'required|min:16',
    ];

    public function saveMessage(){

        $this->validate();

        $message = Message::create([
            'name' => $this->name,
            'email' => $this->email,
            'message' => $this->message,
        ]);

        $this->resetFormFields();
    }

    public function resetFormFields()
    {
        $this->reset(['name', 'email', 'message']);
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.contact-form');
    }
}

```

**Congratulations üèÜ, now you have an awesome, real-time contact form working.  **



### Bonus Tip üèÖ.

If you want to provide a flash message to the user with success or failure after submitting the form, Livewire can do that through a session.

*Update the `saveMessage` method in the `ContactForm.php` class 
*
```
public function saveMessage()
{
    $this->validate();

    $message = Message::create([
        'name' => $this->name,
        'email' => $this->email,
        'message' => $this->message,
    ]);

    if ($message) 
    {
        session()->flash('success', 'Thank you for your Message.');
    } 
    else 
    {
        session()->flash('error', 'Failed to send your message.');
    }

    $this->resetFormFields();
}

```

*And update the form in `contact-form.blade.php` file*

```
<form wire:submit.prevent="saveMessage">
    <div class="card">
        @if (Session()->has('success'))
            <div class="alert alert-success">
                {{ session('success') }}
            </div>
        @endif
        @if (Session()->has('error'))
            <div class="alert alert-danger">
                {{ session('error') }}
            </div>
        @endif
    </div>

    .....

```

> REMEMBER: Livewire component works only if we have a single root element.
